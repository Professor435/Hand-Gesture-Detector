# Hand-Gesture-Detector


I developed a real-time 3D particle visualization system that responds to hand gestures using MediaPipe Hand Tracking and Three.js. This project combines computer vision with WebGL to create an immersive, futuristic experience directly in the browser.

🖐️ Users can control particles using hand movements:
• Move hand to control particle motion
• Pinch to expand or contract shapes
• Point to change color themes
• Open palm to trigger explosion effects

The system includes multiple dynamic particle templates like ❤️ Heart, 🌸 Flower, 🪐 Saturn, 🎆 Firework, and 🌌 Galaxy with customizable color themes and smooth animations.
